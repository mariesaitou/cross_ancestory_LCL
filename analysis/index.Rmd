### **Trans-ethnic eQTL project**
To understand the trans-ethnic genetic architectures of gene expression of a single cell type, which serves as a simplified model to understand trans-ethnic genetic architecture of complex traits.

- eQTL mapping with fastQTL and fine-mapping with SuSiE
- Downstream analysis with allele frequency, differencially expressed genes
- Genetic correlation analysis
- (ongoing) LD-based fine-mapping



### **Note**
I put the scripts just for desplaying and sharing purpose. I did not bring actural datasets and software on this page, so the commands are not executable on-demand here.


### **Procedure**
* [1. Data Cleatning and fastQTL](prep.html)
Obtain genotype and gene expression data, clean them and convert them to the fastQTL format and run the program on UChicago RCC system.
* [2. Fine-mapping with SuSiE](susie.html)
* [3. Downstream analysis]
* [4. Genetic correlation analysis](correl.html)
* [5. LD-based fine-mapping](varLD.html)
* [6. (ongoing) 11.WIP](11.WIP.html)
